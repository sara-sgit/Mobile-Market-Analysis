# Mobile Market Analysis (Microsoft Excel)
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the mobile phone market using Microsoft Excel, with advanced tools such as Power Query for efficient data preparation and transformation. The goal was to uncover how different smartphone specifications and regions impact pricing.
# ðŸ”§ Tools & Techniques:
- Power Query was used to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset.
- Pivot Tables and Charts enabled the visualization of trends and patterns.

## Dataset used

## Key Questions
- How do smartphone specifications influence pricing?
- What is the relationship between RAM size and smartphone price?
- Is there a consistent price increase with more RAM?
- How do camera specifications (e.g., megapixels or multiple lenses) impact cost?
- Which mobile brands offer premium pricing vs. budget-friendly options?
- What are the regional differences in smartphone pricing?
- How have smartphone prices changed over time (yearly trends)?
- What is the cheapest and most expensive smartphone model in the dataset?


## Process
Data Cleaning
With Power query 
- Removed duplicates and resolved inconsistencies within the dataset.
- Handled missing values by imputing or removing them as appropriate.
- Standardized data formats.
- Converted all prices to USD to ensure consistency across regions and enable accurate comparisons.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-  Conducted an initial review to understand the data structure, distribution, and key metrics.
-  Formulated targeted questions to guide deeper analysis (e.g., spec-price relationship, regional trends).

Pivot Table Creation

Built pivot tables to explore:
- The relationship between phone specifications and pricing.
- Price differences across regions.
- Average prices across different companies.


Dashboard Development
- Combined pivot tables into a cohesive and interactive Excel dashboard.
- Incorporated slicers for dynamic filtering by region and company.
- Added a timeline filter to analyze trends over different time period.

## Insights
  
- RAM Size Impact: Higher RAM directly correlates with higher prices â€” phones with 16GB of RAM showed the steepest price increase.
-  Back Camera Influence: Multi-lens setups (e.g., 50MP + 12MP + 48MP) significantly increase a phone's price.

- Processor Effect: Devices using the Unisoc T612 had the highest average price, revealing a strong link between processing power and cost.

- Brand Pricing: Premium brands like Sony, Apple, and Huawei dominate the high-end price range, while brands like Infinix and Realme offer more budget-friendly options.
